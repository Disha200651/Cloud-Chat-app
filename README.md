## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
* npm (usually comes with Node.js)
* A Firebase project set up with Authentication, Firestore, and Realtime Database enabled.
* A Cloudinary account (free tier is sufficient).
* A Google AI Studio API key for Gemini.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd cloud-chat-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase Configuration:**
    * Go to your Firebase project settings -> General tab.
    * Find your Web App's configuration object.
    * Copy these credentials into `src/firebase.js`, replacing the placeholder `firebaseConfig`.
    * **Important:** Make sure to add your `databaseURL` (from the Realtime Database section of Firebase) to the `firebaseConfig` object.

4.  **Set up Cloudinary Configuration:**
    * Go to your Cloudinary dashboard -> Settings -> Upload.
    * Create an **Unsigned Upload Preset**. Note its name.
    * Find your **Cloud Name** on the dashboard.
    * Open `src/pages/ChatPage.js` (and `src/pages/ProfilePage.js`).
    * Replace the placeholder `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` constants with your actual values.

5.  **Set up Gemini API Key:**
    * Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    * Create a file named `.env.local` in the **root** of your project directory (next to `package.json`).
    * Add your API key to this file in the following format:
        ```
        REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    * **Important:** Restart your development server after creating or modifying this file.

6.  **Set up Firestore:**
    * Ensure you have collections named `users` and `chat-rooms`.
    * `users` documents should have fields like `uid`, `email`, `displayName`, `photoURL`, `online`, `last_active`, `lastReadTimes` (map).
    * `chat-rooms` documents should have fields like `name`, `createdAt`, `members` (array). Create initial rooms like "general" and add your UID to their `members` array.
    * Apply the necessary **Firestore Security Rules** (refer to previous instructions for rules covering all features).

### Running the App

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
